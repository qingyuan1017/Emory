HW2 Program: 29/35
  - Program structure? Indentation?
  - Using the NFA from the quiz the output FSM should accept
    the string "aa" but does not.

HW1 Program: 24/25
  - good program; the more important output is the output program
  - use a commandline argument for the input file rather than 
    hard-coding the file name
