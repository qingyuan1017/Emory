For this project, I improve the greedy Tagger method in order to generate a better result.

For the classifier, I use the professor Choi's Naive Bayes and improve the score from 87% to 94%

I improve the get the feature method in my QingTagger in following aspects:

1, add the feature for the previous 1 tag, previous 1 word and next 1 word.

2, add the upper case and number to the feature

3, add some common prefixes and suffixes to the feature.
