# Problem: In the United States is it common that you tip a server at a restaurant
# 15% of the receipt total. Here we ask, if the baristias at a coffee shop are tipped
# at the same rate as a full scale restaurant. The coffee shop data has an mean receipt 
# total per customer of $5.47. So, a baristia would expect to make a mean tip of $0.82 
# per customer. In the given data we have the totals for 5211 customers and in (1) it 
# was was also found that the mean tip of this data is $0.67. Assume the standard 
# deviation of the tips is $0.70.  At 0.05 significance level, can we reject the claim 
# At 0.05 significance level, can we reject the claim that the tips at this coffee shop
# are at 15%?

# Problem: The owner of the coffee shop decides to run a lunch special on Saturday. 
# Test if the lunch specail changed the mean of the ticket total for the day, the 
# owner pulls the sales data for the day. He had 303 customers with a mean ticket 
# price of $5.70. We will take the coffee shop data as the standard. Letting the
# hypothesised mean receipt total per customer be $5.47 with a standar devation of
# $3.40. Using 0.05 significance level, tell the owner if he should run 
# the speical again? What if we change the signifcance level to 0.10?
